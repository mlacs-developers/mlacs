================================================================
:program:`MLACS` - Machine-Learning Assisted Canonical Sampling
================================================================

:program:`MLACS` is a tool to sample a canonical distribution of an atomic system with high accuracy and low computational cost.
The method is based on a variationnally constructed Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential (MLIP) which is optimized in order to
provide the best approximation of the real distribution.
The method has been implemented in the form of a python library, linked with the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulation
code.
