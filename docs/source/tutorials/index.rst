Here you will find several notebooks to show how to use the package for different types of simulations.
The notebooks can also be found in the repository, in the tutorials folder.

:Caution:
          For most of the example here, the parameters used were chosen in order to increase the speed of the simulations.
          Some of these parameters are not adequate for accurate production simulations.
